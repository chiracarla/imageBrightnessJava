# Image Brightness in Java

This project is a simple Java application that helped me learn about image processing. It allows users to change the brightness of a jpg image

## Features
- Accepts a file path to a JPG image
- Allows the user to specify the brightness level
- Gives the option to either overwrite the original image or save the edited image to a new location

## How to Use
1. Run the application.
2. Provide the file path of the JPG image you want to edit.
3. Enter the desired brightness
4. Choose whether to overwrite the original image or save the edited image to a new file.

## Learning Outcome
This project introduced me to basic image manipulation in Java, including:
- Reading and writing image files

## Future Improvements
-other features to edit than brightness(warmth,vibrancy etc.)
- Support for other image formats (PNG, BMP, etc.)
- Customization options for font, size, and color
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction
